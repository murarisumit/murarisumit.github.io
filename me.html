	<h4>What do I like: </h4>

	<ul>
		<li><b>I like learning new things. </b> I like to learn more about basic things, like electricity, music, plays, books ... </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>More about me: </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>I single-task and multi task.</b> I'm onto one task at a time, but multiple task during a day. 
			<ul>
				<li> Learning a language, playing badminton, doing duolingo(20 mins a day), programming are few things I keep on doing every day, but only one thing at a moment</li>.
				<li>I've been otherwise, have seen movie on one side and try to read something on other half of screen. Try to eat food and see movie on other, doesn't work for me.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li> 
			<b>I think very long-term and future-focused.</b>: 
			<ul>
				<li>I have never been to smoking, even when in 4 years of college every year room-mates were all smoker, but I knew it's harmful and would have to leave in future I have thought </li>
				<li> Never went to tattoos or piercing because my thought will I need them in my 80s, not need </li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>I care deeply about very little</b>. I’m committed to just a few people and a few interests. Everything else, I keep away. It’s a simple and sincere life.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>I walk away — to a fault.</b> I’m not a fighter. When something’s not to my liking — or if something gets too confrontational or antagonistic — I just leave. Since I’m happy being alone, the bar is set really high to make me engage with a person or situation that I’m not enjoying.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>I hate noise.</b> I seek silence, that make me happy. Once in a while, like a month I do go place like pubs with dance floor, but if it's goes more than that, I'm not happy.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<b>I hate to waste a single hour.</b> : I feel the precious value of time, most of the time. I imagine my time as worth $500 an hour, and ask myself what’s worth $500. Watching a TV show? Absolutely not. (“Game of Thrones” at 63 hours so far = $31,500 to watch.) Social media? Absolutely not. Focused learning or creating? 
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Don't like lot of talks. </b> I love time spent with my mom and with my brother but I don't like constantly talking over things. I'm happy when they are doing something and happy to see people when they do something they like.Just talk and talk annoy me.
		</li>
