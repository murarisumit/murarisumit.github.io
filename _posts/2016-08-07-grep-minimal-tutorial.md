##### Grep command is used for searching the content of file returning the result.

* Basic syntax: `grep -in "search_term" filename`
  * -n : gives the line-number of matching term in a file
  * -i : Ignore case
* Search in directory: `grep -nr search_term directory`
  * -r : searches recursively in given directory
* List all file with the search_term: `grep -l "search_term" \*`
  * -l : Input needs to be list of files
* List all lines **not/invert-match** with the search_term: `grep -nv "search_term" filename`

* List all file with the search_term **in given directory**: `grep -lr search_term .`
  * `.` represents current directory
* Select only matches that exactly match the whole line: `grep -xr tabular ..`
  * `..` represents the parent directory
* Exclude certain dir: `grep --exclude-dir "_site" -nr "search_text" ."`

Bonus command:

* Using find, xargs and grep for faster search: `find . -iname *.py | xargs grep --color 'search-term'`
    * It list all the python(.py) file and greps through each of the file
    * This is faster, if you've large directory to search and you know which type of file you need.
    * find and grep is powerful combination to use.
