Some basic questions in geometry.

* What is straight line ?
    * It looks complicated but all the heavy words are explained below
    * It's just a _curve_, when it's _tangent vector_ stay tangent when _parallely transported_ along the curve.

* What is curve ?
    * Object similar to a line but that need not be straight. 
    * Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line.

* What is parallel transported ?
	* It means transferring things parallel, here moving vector together, working things in parallel or transposing parallely

* What is vector ? 
    * In physics and geometry, (Euclidean vector or a direction vector), used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction.

* What is tangent vector ? 
	* Any vector that is tangent to curve is tangent vector.
	
* What is tangent to curve ?
	* Tangent vector to curve is the line that touch it only at one point.
