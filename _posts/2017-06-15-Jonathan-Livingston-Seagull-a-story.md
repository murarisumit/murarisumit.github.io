I've been always thinking and fascinated by old indian fables/stories where heroâ€™s  are said to have done
extraordinary things. I still can't understand how someone can do it, now they're treated as GOD. Were they real
characters or they were just fictional stories for entertainment.


While reading this book, found the same thing revolving around my head. Story starts with Jonathan Livingston(a seagull) who tries to outreach him limits, who don't want to live like others(not trying push their limits), he feels flying, he feels himself while he flying fast, but no-one around him is interested in it and furthermore they limit him too.

<center> <pre>Get down Seagulls ever fly in the dark, if you meant to fly in the dark,
you'd have they eyes of an owl!
you would have charts for brains!
you'd have a falcon's short wings. </pre> </center>

It's small book of 127 pages. Small and fascinating story to tell.

Story starts with Jonathon Seagull who pushes his limits than normal gull, and then teaches the same to
Flecther and other student, after jonathon gone fletcher teaches some gulls how to push their limits, during the course author tries to
show the realties that persist around our societies, how we just ceremoniously celebrate leader and forget his
deeds. No-one practices what he teaches instead ceremonies are celebrated the no-one take the love and pain of the
deeds.
