**Shares** : Certificates or book entries representing ownership in a corporation or similar entity.

**Par/Face Value** : 
* Usually important for debt/bonds, because interest is calculated on based of this face value
* Decided when releasing the stocks
* Par value is usually very low in stocks, because company doesn't want to have liability if stock prices go down below the par value 
* It has no connection to the market value of the share of stock

**Outstanding stocks** : 
* Stocks held by shareholders
* Publicly traded companies are obligated to report the number of issued and outstanding shares,

**Treasury stock** : 
* Treasury stock (treasury shares) are the portion of shares that a company keeps in its own treasury
* Treasury stock may have come from a repurchase or buyback from shareholders, or it may have never been issued to the public in the first place
* Treasury stock not considered when calculating dividends or *earnings per share*.
* These are kept in the company's treasury to be used to create extra cash if it is needed. Another reason may be to keep a controlling interest within the treasury to help ward off hostile takeovers.

**Share capital** :  It consists of all funds raised by a company in exchange for shares of their stocks.

**Outstanding share capital** :  Share capital less the par value of shares that are held as the company's treasury stock.

**Earnings per share(EPS)** : 
* A company's profit divided by its number of common outstanding shares. If a company earning ₹200  in one year had 200 common shares of stock outstanding, its EPS would be ₹1 per share.
* The one-year (historical or trailing) **EPS growth rate** is calculated as the percentage change in earnings per share(EPS).
