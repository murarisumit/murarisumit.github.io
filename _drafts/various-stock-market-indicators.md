**Williams PctR**: 
* Traditional settings use -20 as the overbought threshold and -80 as the oversold threshold. 
* These levels can be adjusted to suit analytical needs and security characteristics. 
* Readings above -20 for the 14-day Williams %R would indicate that the underlying security was trading near the top of its 14-day high-low range
* Readings below -80 occur when a security is trading at the low end of its high-low range.
* Prices are above their 6-month average when %R is above -50, which is consistent with an uptrend. Readings below -50 are consistent with a downtrend


**beta-value**
* Very volatile stocks has high beta. Low volatile stocks has low beta.
* Stocks having beta more than one, means market price of this stock is more volatile compared to the Index (like Sensex or Nifty).
* Suppose a stock has beta of 1.3. It means, if Sensex moves down by 10%, its stock price is likely to go down by 13%. Similarly if Sensex goes up by 10%, stocks price (of beta 1.3) is likely to go up by 13%.
