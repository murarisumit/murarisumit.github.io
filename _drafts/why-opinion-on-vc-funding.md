This are my premature thoughts, that I got them while reading https://drewdevault.com/2018/06/05/Should-you-move-to-sr.ht.html

>  In my opinion, venture capital does not lead to healthy businesses or a healthy economy on the whole, and I think the users suffer for it. My approach is different.

I have mixed opinion about it, i think VC funds are required too for breaking big-monopoloies, sometimes it take fund to break big monopoly/duopoly and do that that fund is one of essential components. Also i think it causes harm in lot of places too, most of the times, have seen that this VC money is used to create monopoly instead of breaking it.

So I think if VC fund is used to break big monopoly/duopoly, i would support it up.

If I've to summarised myself now, i think not fan of monopoly and duopoly(it's a new style to go around laws) and a fan of democratising.

I see one point coming out of it, usually distributed model has lots of in-effeciency and monopoly come in existence just to remove them and then finally after it does it, after being monopoly it goes into more worst form of i.e. monopoly with in-effeciency. 

I think point to see is about services and products should be more democratized and keep efficiency in check.
